# OFDM Communication chain  

Run main.m to launch the simulation. The code is divided into multiple cells, each cell corresponds to a lab:  
## Lab 1  
Analyze the communication channel impulse response
## Lab 2  
Modelize the channel using a Rayleigh and Rician distribution
## Lab 3  
Evaluate BER curve when the channel is known
## Lab 4  
Estimate the channel using preamble symbols and evaluate the BER curve
## Lab 5 & 6  
Add synchronization errors: Time of Arrival and Carrier Frequency Offset and compensate these errors
## Lab 7  
Study spatial correlation and angular spectrum of the channel
## Lab 9  
Implement a SIMO communication and improve BER by using spatial correlation between antennas
